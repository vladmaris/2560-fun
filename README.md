# 2560-fun

I'm in pursue of designing a cute datalogger for in-house use; sort of pet project;

Will be able to read two temp sensors, atmopspheric pressure, light intensity, keep time, operate a relay upon some temperature settings and display most of all on a display, all while logging on SD card.

In sha'Allah.
